<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Evaporation Equipment for Whey Products Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Evaporator Drying</li><li>Straight Through Spray Drying</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Evaporation equipment for whey products mainly includes evaporator drying and straight-through spray drying. Evaporator drying involves concentrating whey liquids by removing water through evaporation, enhancing flavor and shelf life. In contrast, straight-through spray drying atomizes the concentrated whey into fine droplets, which rapidly dry in a hot air stream, resulting in a powder form. These methods are crucial in the dairy industry for transforming whey into valuable ingredients, improving usability in food products and boosting profitability.</p></p>
