<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Terrestrial Laser Scanners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Phase Based Scanners</li><li>Time-Of-Flight Scanners</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The terrestrial laser scanners market is primarily divided into two types: phase-based scanners and time-of-flight scanners. Phase-based scanners measure the phase shift of a laser beam to determine distances with high accuracy and speed, making them ideal for applications requiring detailed measurements in short-range scenarios. In contrast, time-of-flight scanners calculate distances by measuring the time it takes for a laser pulse to travel to the target and back, allowing for greater range and versatility in large-scale surveying projects.</p></p>
