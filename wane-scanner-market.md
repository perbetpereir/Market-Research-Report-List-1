<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wane Scanner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Both Side Scan</li><li>Single Side Scan</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wane scanners are specialized tools used in the wood processing industry to assess the quality of lumber. There are two primary market types: both side scan and single side scan. Both side scan wane scanners evaluate both the top and bottom surfaces of the timber simultaneously, providing a comprehensive assessment of wane on each side. In contrast, single side scan wane scanners focus on one side at a time, offering a more targeted analysis but potentially missing defects on the opposite side.</p></p>
